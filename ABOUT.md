# About This Project

This project is part of my Chapter 7 programming assignment. The goal was to build a modular program using Python functions that takes 5 numbers from a user, stores them in a list, and then calculates the lowest, highest, total, and average values.

We weren’t allowed to use built-in functions like `min()`, `max()`, or `sum()` — which made the logic more hands-on and helped me learn how loops work behind the scenes.

Everything is broken up into separate functions to make the program more organized and easier to understand.
