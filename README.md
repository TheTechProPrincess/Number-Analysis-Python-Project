# Number Analysis Program

## What It Does
This program asks the user to enter 5 numbers. Then it figures out:
- The lowest number
- The highest number
- The total of all the numbers
- The average (rounded to 2 decimal places)

It uses Python functions, loops, and lists — and avoids shortcuts like `min()` and `sum()` so we can learn how the logic really works.

## How to Run It
1. Open Python IDLE
2. Run the file `CH7McGowanLillian.py`
3. Type 5 numbers when it asks
4. You'll see the results printed out like this:

Enter number 1: 5
Enter number 2: 10
Enter number 3: 3
Enter number 4: 8
Enter number 5: 6

— Results —
Lowest number: 3.0
Highest number: 10.0
Total: 32.0
Average: 6.40

## Why I Made This
This was for my Chapter 7 assignment in programming class. It helped me learn how to:
- Use functions to organize code
- Store values in lists
- Loop through data manually
- Work with return values and parameters
- Avoid relying on shortcuts so I understand how logic really works
